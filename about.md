## About Me

Hello and welcome! My name is C.S. Rhymes and I'm a full time frontend web developer, based in Brackley, Northants, and an author in my spare time.

## Development

### Web Development

I specialise in PHP and JavaScript frontend development and have learnt on the job and from reading online articles and blogs. I have over ten years experience of web development and have a wide skill set reflecting many years of experience.

My skills range from frontend HTML, CSS and JavaScript, to server side PHP using the Laravel framework, building and consuming APIs, through to nginx and apache server configuration.

Web Development moves at a fast pace and I enjoy learning new techniques and using new tools to help make my work more rewarding. I have used both Vue and React in the past

If you are looking to start web development there are some great resources out there and if you encounter an issue, chances are someone else has encountered it too and posted the solution online. Get stuck in creating and learn as you go!

This is one of the main reasons this website exists. I wanted to record what I learned along the way so I created a blog, which led to this site, which led to me open sourcing the theme.

### Jekyll Themes

This website is built using the [bulma-clean-theme](https://www.csrhymes.com/bulma-clean-theme/), that is also built by me. It is a freely available gem theme that can be used with Jekyll. Full instructions are available on the [GitHub repo page](https://github.com/chrisrhymes/bulma-clean-theme#installation).

Feel free to use this theme as a starting point for your Jekyll sites and take advantage of the [Bulma frontend framework](https://bulma.io/).

Check out the themes I have written on my [Jekyll themes](/themes/) page.

## Writing

### Blogging

One of the reasons I have made this site and the [blog](/blog/) is to post development information that I discovered that may be useful to others.

I also share my recent posts on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/chrisrhymes) if you would like to follow me on there.

### Books

Like a lot of people, I have always wanted to write a book, so I decided to become an author with the help of the self publication service available for Amazon Kindle. As a developer, I find the best way to learn about something new is to go out and try it. As well as writing, editing, then getting the book published, I then used it as a way of learning more about digital marketing to generate interest in the book. One result of that is this website.

I enjoyed writing and publishing the first book so much that I have now written four books.

Details of my books are available on the [books](/books/) page.

### Short Stories

I have also written a few short stories. These can be found on my [stories](/stories) page and also on [Medium](https://medium.com/short-stories-by-cs-rhymes).
