**Nigel's Intranet Adventure, a contemporary tech fiction book with a sprinkling of adventure, comedy and self-discovery.**

Nigel's official job title was 'Intranet Coordinator', but most people in the office didn’t know what his job title was or what he actually did, just seeing him as the IT geek that sat in the corner.

Follow Nigel on an adventure that would change his life forever. The new starter, Dave, throws Nigel’s safe and consistent, but also insanely boring world into chaos.

The new found friendship leads to a journey of technological invention, trickery and wonder.

Go on a journey of self discovery with Nigel as he finds his self confidence and unlocks his true potential.
