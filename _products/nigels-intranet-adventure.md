Nigel worked in an office for a large sales company, his desk in the corner, out of the way of the busy hustle and bustle of the sales and marketing teams. His official job title was 'Intranet Coordinator', but most people in the office didn't know what his job title was or what he actually did, just seeing him as the IT geek that sat in the corner. To be honest, Nigel didn't know what his job was either...

Follow Nigel on an adventure that would change his life forever, all triggered by a chance encounter leading to a new friendship and a journey of technological wonder.
