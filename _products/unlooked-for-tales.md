I have always enjoyed writing. Sometimes I get an idea for a story in my head, but it's not yet fully formed or not suitable to turn into a full length story.

Rather than discard the idea, I will sometimes take the idea and turn it into a very short story, just to see where the idea takes me. In a way, I would call that unlooked-for as I didn't set out to find it, it just found me, hence the name 'unlooked-for tales'.

When doing some research for what these very short stories should be called, I came upon the term 'Flash fiction'. This is defined as a fictional work of extreme brevity that still offers character and plot development. Flash fiction is split further by word count, so I suppose my very short stories could be called "sudden fiction".

This book is a collection of these sudden fiction stories that I have been writing since 2014 and published on my website. I have decided to bring them together in a collection for a new audience, but also added a new story that is exclusive to this collection.
