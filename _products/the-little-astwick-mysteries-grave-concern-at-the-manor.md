**A small village with a big mystery!**

The adventure continues in the second part of The Little-Astwick Mysteries series.

A local metal detectorist, Alan, makes the find of his life in a field just outside the Manor house, which quickly turns into the shock of his life!

David Morgan, a community support officer, and his new friend Evelyn Mckenzie are one again involved in solving the latest mystery set in the fictional English village of Little-Astwick. One story quickly leads into another, uncovering a story that has laid hidden for centuries.
