**A small English village with a big mystery.**

David and Evelyn return in the third instalment of The Little Astwick Mysteries. David fends off a mystery attacker before he himself disappears. DI Barksley gets called into action to investigate the suspicious circumstances of David's disappearance.

When there is no sign of either David or Evelyn, Barksley turns to his old friend George for help, unsure who he can really trust anymore.

Discover more about the centuries of myths and legends of Little-Astwick and the secrets of Arthur Androse and his architectural genius.

Follow David and Evelyn as they fight for freedom, as well as following Barksley and George as they uncover more of The Little-Aswtick Mystery.
